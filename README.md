# JuniorPapers
A record of past mentorship where I've helped high school students begin their careers as researchers.

There are four papers, named by their topics: 

- Transfer learning with VGG16
- Reinforcement learning with Q-Learning
- Self learning with SimSiam (through the SHTEM 2023 program)
- Data selection with Data Shapley (through the SHTEM 2022 program)
